# FPS Game using Raycasting

## Overview
This is a basic first-person shooter (FPS) game implemented in C using SDL2 for rendering. The game uses a raycasting engine to render a 3D environment, allowing the player to navigate through a maze and interact with the world.

## Features
- Raycasting engine for rendering 3D walls
- Player movement and rotation using keyboard and mouse
- Basic collision detection
- Texture mapping for walls
- User-data persistence for saving and loading game state

## Requirements
- **SDL2**: Simple DirectMedia Layer 2
- **SDL2_image**: For texture loading

Install SDL2 and SDL2_image on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
